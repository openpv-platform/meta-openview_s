# Description 
- RS485 is a serial communication protocol used to connect our stm32 micro processor to external devices. In this case, it is used to communicate with the BWG pac controller for the Balboa spa / hot tub.
- In the current RCD image, the UART internal peripheral that uses RS485 is assigned to the Linux OS and thus controlled by the serial and TTY frameworks (non-secure A7 instance).

# Hardware Verification
To validate our hardware we should:
   - Create a C application that uses the serial/TTY framework to communicate with a host PC.

To generalize RS485 functionality:
   - create a shared library with functions to:
      - open a connection
      - send an RS485 packet
      - read received packet
      - close a connection
