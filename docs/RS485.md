# Description 
- RS485 is a serial communication protocol used to connect our stm32 micro processor to external devices. In this case, it is used to communicate with the BWG pac controller for the Balboa spa / hot tub.
- In the current RCD image, the UART internal peripheral that uses RS485 is assigned to the Linux OS and thus controlled by the serial and TTY frameworks (non-secure A7 instance).


# To generalize RS485 functionality:
Create a shared library with functions to
   - open a connection
   - send an RS485 packet
   - read received packet
   - close a connection

# Design 
- User calls initRs485()
   - Rs485Device class is created and parameter based constructor is called with input arguments designed to set rs485 config options like baud rate, call back, etc.
