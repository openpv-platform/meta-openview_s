The goal of the page is to capture both the data as well as the rationale behind a meeting with @<58F7801D-9620-65D7-9A8B-8C4D3EC94313> and @<8AF92057-AAF2-699C-989D-74C1A25F1C1F> on 2021-12-16.

When thinking through "Time to Market", we used the method of understanding that ST4 must be available for production orders on/near 2023-01-01 in order to avoid a year's delay to revenue. With that goal in place, we then worked backward to needing "Controlled Customer Demos" of the ST4 version of the RCD including all of the MVP features on/around 2022-07-01.

Additionally, customers will need units "in-hand" on/around 2022-09-01 such that they can be ready for the "Spa Exhibition Circuit" (TODO: @<58F7801D-9620-65D7-9A8B-8C4D3EC94313> - Please add more details, thanks!) in October of '22.

The picture below attempts to identify the software-based feature that are required for the ST4 Variant of the RCD. Specifically, it's calling out that there will need to be a base MVP release of the software that contains:
- ST4 UX - It's assumed @<BF422867-1637-6F77-B98E-6A81A072A857>'s team will do the UX development work (in whatever UX environment they select).
- OTA Update Support - It's assumed @<2FC32582-A7B6-691F-8F7C-06A5D5B111BB>'s team will lead the development of the base OTA support module with implementation of the actual updates coming from Chris' team.
- It's expected that Siana-Systems will lead the development of the Microphone/Speaker drivers as well as the higher-level support for Alexa.
- It's expected HCEE (likely @<682468CF-4487-6C4C-B5E2-B4C698C89B03>) will implement the WiFi drivers enabling support for Alexa and OTA Updates.

When looking at the product from a certification standpoint, we will need to have the "Revision B" hardware verified by 2022-07-01. The actual details of exactly what needs to be certified are still mushy in my head and I believe we need to have that fully documented ASAP.

Looking at manufacturing, the following tasks were identified as being critical to the overall project:
- EOL Tester (It sounds like @<024EB7FA-5BE3-6953-BC47-BE6BEE708D1C> will handle that, but will need significant support from RCD Development Team)
- DFM Review (As this product will be manufacturing in the TJ facility, we will need to follow their process. @<58F7801D-9620-65D7-9A8B-8C4D3EC94313> recommends a DFM review on/by 3/15)
- New Spacer - @<D78DC42B-0B75-6627-A3BA-1B9909339B25> still has a new spacer that needs to be designed and tooling must be created.
- Potting Material- As we'll be using a new potting material, the machinery required must be procured as well as the material itself.
- BGA Support - We will need to work with the Mfg Facility to TJ (TODO: @<58F7801D-9620-65D7-9A8B-8C4D3EC94313> - to whom should we assign this task?) to make sure we have the correct equipment required for producing PCBAs that include BGAs.
